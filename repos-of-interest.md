**Repositories of Interest**

Implementations - This is a list of singleton implementations, plugins that only have one example in the wild. Its separated from the implementations with alternatives list for clarity. 

Implementations with Alternatives - This is a list of repositories containing plugins that do the same thing, but differently. They represent a collection of different ways to do the task, from which the best parts of each implementation can be incorporated into the organisation's canonical version (licences permitting)

Collections or Bundles - This is a list of repositories containing multiple plugins of interest. They may be a collection or just a bundle of plugins that were included as part of a larger django-cms site related repo or otherwise not cleaved out into their own repositories by the authors. The plugins inside these will be 'deep linked' in the alternate implementations list where appropriate so that its clear why these bundles are being listed.
